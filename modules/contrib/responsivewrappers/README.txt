INTRODUCTION
------------

Bootstrap responsive wrappers module adds a new filter in your input formats
that checks the content and adds the video wrapper for responsive videos with
16/9 or 4/3 aspect ratio, the table wrapper and the image class.

This is useful because users can use the WYSIWYG to add vídeos, tables or images
and magically append the responsive wrappers, without the need to allow users to
create divs or know or remember to add the bootstrap responsive wrapper or
classes.
